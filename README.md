# 🌸 K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset

## 📌 Introduction
This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence course** with the objective of applying the **K-Means Clustering algorithm** using **Scikit-Learn** to cluster the famous **Iris dataset**.  

The Iris dataset contains **150 samples** across three species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*), each with 4 features:  
- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load and clean the dataset  
   - Normalize features  
   - Explore data distribution  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Pie chart for class distribution  
   - Histograms for individual features  
   - Pairplot to visualize relationships among features  

3. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Apply **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters (K)  
   - Perform clustering with K-Means  
   - Visualize results using scatter plots  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)  
   - Silhouette Score  

---

## 📊 Results
- Optimal number of clusters: **K = 3**  
- The clustering aligns well with the actual species labels.  
- Visualizations include:  
  - **Elbow Method plot** showing K=3 as optimal  
  - **Scatter Plot** with clear separation among clusters
